# CSCI 432: Advanced Algorithm Topicss, Fall 2019 #

This repository is for class materials for CSCI 432 in Fall 2019, taught by Prof. Fasy.

MSU Course Catalog Description: 
A rigorous examination of advanced
algorithms and data structures. Topics include average case analysis,
probabilistic algorithms, advanced graph problems and theory, distributed and
parallel programming.

From the Instructor: This course is NOT a programming class, and is not
structured like the 132 and 232 courses the precede it.  In this course, we will
do many proofs (especially using induction), and will be writing pseudo-code, not
code.

Prerequisites:
CSCI 246 (Discrete) and CSCI 232 (Data Structures and
Algorithms) are a prerequisite for this course.  
In particular, a student enrolled in CSCI 432
should be familiar with sorting algorithms, big-Oh notation, 
proof by induction and by contradiction, and discrete probability.

## Course Outcomes and Objectives

This course introduces students to the analysis and design of computer
algorithms. In this course, students will:

* Analyze asymptotic time and space complexity of algorithms.
* Describe algorithmic design paradigms (including dynamic programming,
  greedy algorithms, divide and conquer) and explain when an algorithmic design
  situation calls for it.
* Apply methods of analysis (prove
  correctness, time/space complexity, termination) to new
  problems.
* Use and analyze major graph algorithms and data structures.
* Design NP completeness reductions.
* Analyze algorithms from recent research publications.

The preferred method to ask questions relating to this class is a public post on
Piazza.  Please use [this link](TODO) to sign up
for the course in Piazza.

* [Link to Piazza course page](TODO) - use this link once you are signed up for the class.
* You can direct message Prof. Fasy and the TAs in Piazza, but if you would prefer to email Prof. Fasy, please
use: brittany.fasy@montana.edu.  

Office hours: 

* Prof. Fasy: TODO, and by appointment.
* TA: TODO 

## What is in this repository?

The folders in this repository contain all materials for this class.

- lec_notes: Copies of lecture notes and board photos.
- hw: homework assignments, as well as a LaTex template for your submissions. 

The schedule is at the bottom of this Markdown file.  If you want to learn more
about Markdown, check out [this tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

## Accessing this Repo

The repository is set as public, so you can access all course materials easily.
I suggest creating a fork, so that you can use your fork to maintain your own
materials for this class.  See the resources section below for forking directions.

To clone this repo:
```
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/msu-cs/csci-246-fall2018.git
```

## Other Course Tools 

- Group discussions, questions, and announcements will be through [Piazza](TODO).
- Homework will be graded on Gradescope TODO
 

## Grading
Your grade for this class will be determined by:

- 5% Attendance 
- 30% Homework
- 10% Online Quizzes 
- 20% Midterm I
- 20% Midterm II
- 15% Final 

A grade above an 90 will earn at least an A-, above a 80 will earn at least a 
B-, above 70 will earn at leat a C-, and above 60 will earn at least D-.

## Class Policies

### Policy on Class Attendance

Class attendance and participation is required.  Attendance will be randomly
taken throughout the semester.

### Policy on Homework 

All assignments must be submitted by 23:59 on the due date. Late
assignments will not be accepted.

Throughout this semester, we will have 12 homework assignments.  The best 10 grades
will count towards the homework grade.

For descriptive assignments and reports, the submission should be typeset
(preferably in LaTex), and
submitted as a PDF both in D2L and Gradescope. Each problem should be started on a fresh page.

For code assignments,
well organized source code with clear comments should be submitted.

### Policy on Collaboration
Collaboration is encouraged on all aspects of the class, except where explicitly 
forbidden. Note:

- All collaboration (who and what) must be clearly indicated in writing on 
anything turned in.  
- Homework may be solved collaboratively except as explicitly forbidden, 
but solutions must be written up **independently**. 
This is best done by writing your solutions when not in a group setting.
Groups should be small 
enough that each member plays a significant role.

### Classroom Etiquette

Except for note taking and group work requiring a computer, please keep electronic devices off during
class, as they can be distractions to other students. Disruptions to the class will
result in being asked to leave the lecture, and one half-point will be deducted
from the attendance grade.

### Withdrawing

After 20 October 2018, I will only support requests to withdraw from this course
with a ``W" grade if extraordinary personal circumstances exist.
If you are considering withdrawing from this class, discussing this with me as 
early as possible is advised.  Since this class involves a project, the 
decision to withdraw must be discussed with me, and with your group.

### Special Needs Information

If you have a documented disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation(s), please contact me and Disabled
Student Services within the first two weeks of class.



## MSU Policies

### Academic Integrity

The integrity of the academic process requires that credit be given where credit
is due. Accordingly, it is academic misconduct to present the ideas or works of
another as one's own work, or to permit another to present one's work without
customary and proper acknowledgment of authorship. Students may collaborate with
other students only as expressly permitted by the instructor. Students are
responsible for the honest completion and representation of their work, the
appropriate citation of sources and the respect and recognition of others'
academic endeavors.

Plagiarism will not be tolerated in this course. According to the Meriam-Webster
dictionary, plagiarism is `the act of using another person's words or ideas
without giving credit to that person.'  Proper credit means describing all
outside resources (conversations, websites, etc.), and explaining the extent to
which the resource was used.  Penalties for plagiarism at MSU include (but are
not limited to) failing the assignment, failing the class, or having your degree
revoked.  This is serious, so do not plagiarize.
Even inadvertent or unintentional misuse or appropriation of another's work
(such as relying heavily on source material that is not expressly acknowledged)
is considered plagiarism. 

By participating in this class, you agree to abide by the Student Code of
Conduct.  This includes the following academic expectations:

- be prompt and regular in attending classes;
- be well-prepared for classes;
- submit required assignments in a timely manner;
- take exams when scheduled, unless rescheduled under 310.01;
- act in a respectful manner toward other students and the instructor and in a way
          that does not detract from the learning experience; and
- make and keep appointments when necessary to meet with the instructor. 


## MSU Drug and Alcohol Policies

Per the Code of Conduct for students, no student may come to class under the
influence of drugs or alcohol, as that would not be `Fostering a healthy, safe
and productive campus and community.`  See [Alcohol and Drug Policies
Website](http://www.montana.edu/deanofstudents/alcoholanddrugs.html) for more
information.  In particular, note:

As a federally-funded institution, we must adhere to all federal laws when it
comes to alcohol and drug use or distribution. This holds true for marijuana as
well. Using or distributing marijuana on or off campus is a violation of our
code of conduct even if a student has a medical card or comes from a state in
which marijuana is legal or has been decriminalized.

As noted, the University's alcohol and drug policies apply off campus. Using
drugs and/or alcohol and returning to your residence hall in a disruptive
fashion- either via odor, noise, destruction, etc- can lead to residence life
policy and alcohol or drug policy violations. Remember, not everyone wants to
hear or smell you.
