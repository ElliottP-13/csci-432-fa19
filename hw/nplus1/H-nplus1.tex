\maketitle

This is your final assignment for CSCI 432.

Write a two-page paper describing to me how you have grown as a student,
computer
scientist, mathematician, engineer, or a researcher in this class, and more generally,
in this
semester.  To support your argument, you should include your
homework or writing samples (or excerpts from them) in an appendix as
evidence (and reference them!)

If you do not feel that you've grown,
explain why.

Remember, style counts. Use complete sentences.

I have grown in a number of ways this semester. I am currently a Physics and Computer Science major; however, I am planning on switching to Mathematics and Computer Science. Because these fields are very math-intensive, my mathematical abilities have grown significantly. I significantly strengthened my ability to recognize different types of problems so that I can quickly find a solution. 

The course puts a large emphasis in proving algorithm correctness. This has strengthened my ability to write formal proofs. This forces me to look at each problem with a very critical eye and ask myself at each step why that step must be true. This has been ingrained into my thought patterns so that I think of doing these proofs as I work through any mathematical process. I often think of what the loop invariant will be when I create any loop and how this leads to the final solution. This is very helpful when writing new algorithms as I think more in advance about how the pieces fit together and if my algorithm will produce the result that I anticipated.

Thinking through proofs is also helpful when solving physics problems as I consider each algebraic step and ensure that it is mathematically correct. This significantly reduces the number of 'silly' errors made while solving equations. I convince myself that each step is right and once I know that every step is right I know that I have reached the right solution. This allows me to be much more flexible in solving problems as I don't have to memorize a very specific equation for each problem, but I can re-derive or modify more simple equations and laws to arrive at the solution.
