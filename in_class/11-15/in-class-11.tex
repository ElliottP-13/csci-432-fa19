\section*{Concurrent Programming}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism? (Feel
        free to use the internet if you are unsure).
        \vspace{1in}

    \item Give an short example of a \emph{race condition},
        where running concurrent
        threads could result in multiple outputs.  Explain all of the possible
        outputs of your example, and label each as \emph{desirable} or \emph{not
        desirable}.
        \vspace{3in}

    \item Consider the two problems on the Collatz conjecture (sections 12.13
        and 19.9).  Test the Collatz conjecture for $n=5$.
        \vspace{1in}

    \item Give pseudocode for the parallel version of the Collatz check.
        \vspace{3in}

    \item The EPI book discusses the trade-off between the cost of starting
        threads and the benefit for having things run concurrently (and
        hopefully in parallel).  What do you conjecture to be the difference for
        the optimal number of threads to be running in different programming
        languages (for the same algorithm)?
\end{enumerate}
